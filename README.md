## Mack
<br />
<em>It's like slack but shittier</em>
<br />

### What Purpose Does Mack Serve?
--Not much if im being honest. I used this project to learn TypeScript, WebSockets, and improve my SQL queries.--
Mack is going to take over the world and be the worlds first non-invasive chat app <br />

### Future Goals
For now I am taking my time and making sure the chat aspect of the app has all the bells and whistles. After that I aim to add some sort of video streaming/ video call aspect.(*Which is bold of me I know*) <br />
There are still a few things that need to be added.<br />
<ul>
<li>Ability to send images / custom stickers (will probably use AWS S3 for storage)</li>
<li>Optomized Room generation</li>
<li>More personaliztion to the app (profile picture, small bio, custom color theme)</li>
</ul>

### How To Run
BackEnd: <code>run npm i</code>Then<code>run: npm run build</code> *run this first*<br />
FrontEnd: <code>run npm i</code>Then<code>run: npm start</code><br />
